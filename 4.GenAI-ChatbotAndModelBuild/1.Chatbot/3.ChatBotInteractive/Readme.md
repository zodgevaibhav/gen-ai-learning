# How to Run a Streamlit Program

Follow these steps to run your Streamlit application:

## 1. Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed.  
Check with:
```bash
python --version
```

## 2. Install Streamlit

Install Streamlit using pip:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```

## 3. Prepare Your Streamlit Script

Ensure your main Streamlit script (e.g., `3.WebBased_WithHistory.py`) is ready in your project directory.

## 4. Run the Streamlit App

Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run:
```bash
streamlit run 3.WebBased_WithHistory.py
```

## 5. Open in Browser

After running, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`).  
Open this URL in your web browser to interact with your app.
