## Types of Regression Analysis

- **Linear Regression**: When the dependent variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Logistic Regression**: When the dependent variable is binary (e.g., predicting whether an email is spam or not).
    

## Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation for Classification

This program demonstrates the use of Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation to classify data. Below is a detailed explanation of the techniques, methods, and their purpose in the program.

Use LogisticRegressionCV when:

- You are performing binary or multi-class classification.
- You want to automatically optimize the regularization strength (C).
- You have limited data and need cross-validation to ensure a more robust model.
- You want to prevent overfitting by finding the best trade-off between bias and variance.

- Example Use Cases:
  - Spam detection (Spam vs. Not Spam)
  - Disease diagnosis (Has disease vs. No disease)
  - Customer churn prediction (Will leave vs. Will stay)

### 1. **Libraries Used**
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks such as model building, evaluation, and cross-validation.

### 2. **Dataset**
The dataset used in this program is `hearing_test.csv`. It contains features and a target column `test_result` which indicates the classification outcome.

---

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA is performed to understand the dataset:
- **Columns**: Displays the column names.
- **Head & Tail**: Shows the first and last few rows of the dataset.
- **Info**: Provides information about the dataset, such as data types and non-null counts.
- **Describe**: Summarizes the dataset with statistical measures.
- **Correlation**: Computes the correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.

---

### 4. **Data Preprocessing**
- The target column `test_result` is separated from the features.
- The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`. The `random_state` ensures reproducibility of the split.

---

### 5. **Model Building**
- **Logistic Regression with Cross-Validation**: The `LogisticRegressionCV` model is used, which performs logistic regression with built-in cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters.

---

### 6. **Model Training**
The model is trained using the training dataset (`x_train` and `y_train`) with the `fit` method.

---

### 7. **Model Testing**
- Predictions are made on the test dataset (`x_test`) using the `predict` method.
- The performance of the model is evaluated using:
    - **Confusion Matrix**: A table summarizing the prediction results.
    - **Accuracy Score**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

---

## 8. **Key Outputs**
- **Confusion Matrix**: Helps understand the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
    - A table summarizing the prediction results. Below is an example of a confusion matrix:

      ```
      [[50  5]
       [ 3 42]]
      ```

      - **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted positive cases.
      - **True Negatives (TN)**: Correctly predicted negative cases.
      - **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted positive cases.
      - **False Negatives (FN)**: Incorrectly predicted negative cases.

- **Accuracy Score**: Indicates the overall performance of the model.
    - Predictions are made on the test dataset (`x_test`) using the `predict` method.
    - The performance of the model is evaluated using:

      ```
      Accuracy Score: 0.92
      ```

      This indicates that the model correctly predicted 92% of the test cases.

## 9. **How to Run**
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`).
2. Place the `hearing_test.csv` file in the same directory as the script.
3. Run the script to view the outputs, including the confusion matrix and accuracy score.

---

### 10. **Future Improvements**
- Perform feature scaling for better model performance.
- Experiment with other classification algorithms.
- Use additional evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
